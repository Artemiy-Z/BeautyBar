# Project Beauty Bar - an Android-compatible App for managing beauty-related businesses
## Main goals
When I started this project, I had several goals in mind:
- polish my programming skills and learn to use Kotlin for Android development;
- learn how to construct adaptable and interactable user interfaces using Jetpack Compose;
- learn how to make lightweight, expandable App navigation using Cicerone.
## Features
### Admin managing
Lets administrator create and edit: 
- categories of services;
- services;
- masters that work in certain schedules.
### User experience
Common users can sign in and sign up as new users to access such features as:
- view catalog;
- read descriptions for any service;
- edit profile details;
- book services and specify master they will be working with, date and time;
- view and cancelling bookings.
### master experience
Masters can sign in using login-password that they get from admins, and get access to these features:
- view bookings that are scheduled to them;
- edit profile details.
## Conclusion
Project's goals have been achieved and I have learned a lot about such technologies as:
- UI/UX framework Jetpack Compose;
- Navigation framework Cicerone
- Database management using Supabase.
